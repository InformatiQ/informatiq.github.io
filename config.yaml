        #### What is it?
        Coaching is a form of development in which an experienced person, called a coach, supports a learner, called coachee, in achieving a specific personal or professional goal by providing training and guidance.  
        In simple terms, coaching is an opportunity for the coachee to take the time to work on themselves with the help of a coach.  
        The coach helps the coachee in gaining clarity on their goals. Be mindful of their current ways. Paint a picture of the destination and support them in getting there.

        #### How does it go?
        A coaching program has a start and an end.
        * It starts with the coachee having a topic to work on that is important to them and their development.
        * A discovery session, in which the coach and the coachee learn a little about each other, break the ice. They will also start to discover the topic. The purpose is for both to get clarity on the topic.
        * In the next session, the coach will propose a coaching program that is customized to the coachee that runs over several sessions (4-6 months). They will discuss and refine it together.
          The program will have clear goals and exercises to help the coachee achieve them.
        * Finally, a closing session to review and celebrate the change.  
        
        Yet the journey doesn’t stop there, the coach merely helps the coachee get on the path to achieving their goals.  
        After the program is over, the work continues and the coachee continues on their journey of growth without the coach.

        I had a career as an individual contributor in tech. Part of my job was to mentor less experienced engineers.  
        Later I moved into management, and started managing teams. This time mentoring was a big part of my job, both mentoring engineersd and less experienced managers.  
        I always found mentoring useful, but for me, I didn't want advice, I was more looking to learn things myslef, finding my way. That's when I learned about coaching.  
        I started integrating it in my tools as a manager. Quite a powerful tool too.  
        Coaching others helped me personally get better, and as I am who I am I did coaching in my own way after a lot of reading and experimenting with styles.  
        Later I had my own coaching experience a s a coachee, and it was an amazing experience. An eye opener.  
        
        I have learned by doing, and went for coaching training. I have been able to help managers and engineers with their growth journeys.  
        This has given me tremendous satisfaction. Coaching is quite rewarding and humbling.  
        Today I am here to be available for a bigger audience. Schedule a call
